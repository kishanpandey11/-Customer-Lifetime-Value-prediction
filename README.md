# Customer-Lifetime-Value-prediction
**In this Dataset customer Lifetime Value is the target variable.**
1) Customer Lifetime Value is defined as, “The total value of direct and indirect contributions to overhead and profit by an individual customer during the entire customer lifecycle that is - from the start of the relationship until its projected ending”.
2) CLV evaluates the long-term value of customers with the company.
3) It is a powerful measure used not only to determine which clients have the most potential, but also to decide how much marketing expenditures is justified for each segment.

**I have tried to segment customers based on their education, employment status, vehicle class, their state and location code to gain important insights and find which segment is more profitable segment. I Have created these graphs on ***Tableau***.**

**I have used ***Decision Tree Regressor***, ***Random Forest Regressor***, ***Gradient Boost***, ***XGBoost Regressor*****

**Among all the models I have applied Random Forest is Performing best**
